# Citizen Wallet Project

The citizen wallet combines functionality that enables standardized communication with the government.
Citizen services are often complex to use, require multiple accounts and make it challenging to find the right person to talk to.
The citizen wallet hosts your private information on your systems away from government portals, while at the same time organizing it in a way that makes it easy to share with insitituation if you choose to.

Similar to a crypto currency wallet, the citizen wallet is your private FOSS software that enables you to interface securly with the decentralized system, called "federal democracy".
